## What is this?

A GUI to spawn enemies in a certain turned based anime game.

![Demo](Demo.png)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Copy and paste your `Lunar Core Handbook.txt` from LunarCore into the cloned folder
3. Specify your UID in `options.py`
4. Run `Setup.bat`
5. Once dependencies have installed successfully, run `python main.py` or `Run.bat`

## How to use

- Scene = Where the battle will take place (Not all scenes will work)
- Amount = Amount of props (Prop is the thing that you hit/hits you to initiate the battle)
- Level = Level of the enemy
- Radius = How far away/apart the props will spawn
- Enemy = What you're about to be ambushed by
